### Intro

I'm Dauren, a Duke Data Science graduate with over four years of experience in Data Science across multiple industries. I'm committed to lifelong learning and continuously developing my skills. Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, and boxing.

### Notable Projects

1. [Prediction-churn reduction package](https://github.com/brauden/prediction-churn) with the implementation of Knowledge Distillation and Regress to Corrected Prediction methods for the PyTorch framework.

2. [AWS ML pipeline](https://github.com/HarTigran/Finalproject) for finding similar cars in Craigslist by implementing CNN feature extraction model, AWS Lambda, AWS SQS, Streamlit, and FastAPI stack.

3. [Estimating the impact of support team assisted response in Denver](https://github.com/MIDS-at-Duke/uds-2022-701-team-5) by employing difference-in-differences technique.

### What's Next
The next things I want to learn are Unity game engine for models animation, and AWS Kinesis for real-time data processing.
